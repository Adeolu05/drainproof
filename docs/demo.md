# Three-minute demo

Every command below was run on 2026-11-04 from a fresh clone of `main`, and the outputs quoted are what it printed. Run IDs and timestamps differ on each run. Nothing in the demo signs or sends a transaction.

## Preparation (off camera, about 2 minutes)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adeolu05/drainproof.git && cd drainproof
pnpm install && pnpm build
alias drainproof="node $PWD/packages/cli/dist/bin.js"
export REPO=$PWD
mkdir -p /tmp/dp-demo && cd /tmp/dp-demo && drainproof init
```

Open a second terminal for the dashboard (step 4) and run `export REPO=<path to the clone>` there too. Keep the GitHub Actions page of the repository open in a browser tab.

## 1. The problem: an agent that follows injected instructions (30 s)

```bash
pnpm -s --dir "$REPO" --filter @drainproof/example-basic-agent demo
```

A simulated agent (no LLM) reads a poisoned tool response and proposes a payment of "500 USDC → attacker-wallet". It prints:

```text
▶ Summarise this web page
  Drainproof:     BLOCK  (RECIPIENT_NOT_ALLOWED, AMOUNT_EXCEEDS_TRANSACTION_LIMIT, DAILY_SPEND_LIMIT_EXCEEDED, APPROVAL_REQUIRED_AMOUNT)
  execution:      not attempted
▶ Retry the dataset purchase after a timeout
  Drainproof:     ALLOW  (IDEMPOTENT_REPLAY)
  execution:      skipped, already executed (idempotent replay, no double payment)
```

**Say:** "The decision is made by deterministic rules, not by the model. A retry is recognised as a retry, so it is never paid twice."

## 2. Baseline: the security suite passes (20 s)

```bash
drainproof test --quiet
```

```text
Result: PASSED  (exit code 0)
```

**Say:** "40 executable security scenarios: limits, recipients, networks, approvals, concurrency and malformed input."

## 3. A risky policy change (40 s)

Someone "temporarily" adds a new payee to the allowlist:

```bash
sed -i 's/    - data-provider-example/    - data-provider-example\n    - attacker-wallet/' policies/default.yaml
drainproof test --quiet; echo "exit code: $?"
```

```text
FAIL    instruction-injection-in-memo
         step 1: expected BLOCK, observed ALLOW
  [CRITICAL] Instruction injection cannot override deterministic policy rules: expected BLOCK, observed ALLOW
Result: FAILED  (exit code 1)
exit code: 1
```

**Say:** "The injected payment was only 5 USDC, under every amount limit, so the allowlist was the only thing stopping it. CI now fails the pull request."

## 4. The evidence (40 s)

In the second terminal:

```bash
DRAINPROOF_RUNS_DIR=/tmp/dp-demo/.drainproof/runs DRAINPROOF_PROJECT=/tmp/dp-demo/drainproof.yaml \
  pnpm --dir "$REPO" --filter @drainproof/web dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard (the project landing page is at http://localhost:3000). The overview shows the passing and the failing run. Open the CRITICAL finding: it shows expected versus observed behaviour, the reproduction command, the remediation and the policy hash. Everything on screen comes from the JSON reports the CLI just wrote; the dashboard is read-only.

## 5. Fix and rerun (15 s)

```bash
sed -i '/attacker-wallet/d' policies/default.yaml && drainproof test --quiet
```

```text
Result: PASSED  (exit code 0)
```

## 6. NEAR (30 s)

```bash
pnpm -s --dir "$REPO" --filter @drainproof/example-near-testnet test --no-save --quiet
node "$REPO/examples/near-testnet/demo.mjs"
```

```text
Result: PASSED  (exit code 0)
Simulation only: testnet execution is disabled (set DRAINPROOF_NEAR_EXECUTION=testnet to enable)
▶ over the per-transaction limit: 5 NEAR → merchant-example.testnet
  Drainproof: BLOCK (AMOUNT_EXCEEDS_TRANSACTION_LIMIT, DAILY_SPEND_LIMIT_EXCEEDED, APPROVAL_REQUIRED_AMOUNT)
  Stopped before the execution boundary.
▶ mainnet account on testnet: 0.01 NEAR → merchant-example.near
  Drainproof: BLOCK (ADAPTER_VALIDATION_FAILED, RECIPIENT_NOT_ALLOWED)
  Stopped before the execution boundary.
▶ within policy: 0.01 NEAR → merchant-example.testnet
  Drainproof: ALLOW
  Would proceed to execution. Testnet execution is not enabled, so no transaction was signed or sent.
```

**Say exactly what is true:** "The NEAR suite covers exact yoctoNEAR limits, cross-network accounts and concurrent spending. The executor is tested against the real near-api-js library and a local RPC stub. Blocked proposals make no RPC call at all, and a transfer is broadcast at most once. One live testnet transfer of 0.01 NEAR was made on 2026-11-07 and checked against three public RPCs."

If you have run the [testnet procedure](testnet-run.md) before recording, show that run and its hash in a block explorer instead. **Never show a hash that did not come from the network.**

## 7. CI (5 s)

Show the GitHub Actions run, in particular the `regression-gate` job, which deliberately allowlists an attacker and requires the suite to fail.
