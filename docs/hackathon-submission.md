# NEAR HACKATHON submission

## Rules

These rules were confirmed by the project owner from the official NEAR HACKATHON rules.

| Item | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Submission window | 1 Nov 2026, 00:00 UTC to **14 Nov 2026, 23:59 UTC** |
| Judging | 16 to 18 Nov 2026. The jury includes AI judges (Claude Code and Codex) that clone the repository and follow the README. |
| Submissions | One per team. A submission cannot be edited after it is sent. |
| Tracks for this entry | Primary: **06 AI Security & Defense**. Secondary: **07 Agent Economy**. |

## Required deliverables

| Requirement | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Public repository | Done: https://github.com/Adeolu05/drainproof (public API returned 200 on 2026-11-06) |
| README with "do X, see Y" steps an AI judge can follow | Done: [For judges: verify in 5 minutes](../README.md#for-judges-verify-in-5-minutes). Every command was run from a fresh clone on 2026-11-05 and the expected output is the real output. |
| Public X demo post that states the project was built at NEAR HACKATHON, with a video or screenshots | **To do (owner).** Screenshots are in `docs/images/` and the demo script is [demo.md](demo.md). |
| A mainnet NEAR account for the prize payout | **To do (owner).** Only the account ID is submitted. No mainnet key belongs anywhere in this repository, and nothing in it signs on mainnet. |
| "What did you build?" description, 20 to 2,000 characters, covering the problem, the implementation and NEAR's role | **Draft below** (1,846 characters, counted with `wc -m`). Leads with CI: the GitHub Action and the scenarios against both the engine and the vault. |
| No secrets anywhere in the git history | **Pending** a full-history secret scan in the final audit. By design, keys are only read from environment variables, which `.env.example` documents with empty values. |

## "What did you build?" (draft)

```text
Drainproof: is your AI agent drainproof? It is the test suite for an AI agent's money rules. On every pull request, attack scenarios run against the agent's spending policy, off-chain in a policy engine and on-chain in a NEAR vault contract, and the pull request fails when a change would let the agent be drained.

Problem: an agent with a wallet can be talked into paying the wrong account, paying twice after a retry, or overspending through parallel requests. Many tools enforce spending rules; few test them. A policy file is code, and a one-line change to an allowlist or a limit can quietly open a hole.

Implementation: a deterministic TypeScript policy engine (no LLM in the decision) checks every proposed payment against a YAML policy: per-payment and daily limits, recipient and network allowlists, and approval thresholds, with exact integer amounts, atomic reservations, idempotent retries and fail-closed errors. A scenario runner attacks the policy with 40 scenarios (prompt injection, boundary amounts, races, replayed approvals, malformed input) and a look-alike recipient pack (0/o, 1/l, rn/m), against the engine, your own guard code or the vault. A GitHub Action runs it with one step and a policy file, writes the findings to the job summary and fails the check.

NEAR's role: the Drainproof Vault, a NEAR smart contract in Rust, holds the funds and enforces the same policy on-chain. The agent holds only a function-call access key for one method, so the protocol itself stops a compromised agent from withdrawing, calling other methods or paying directly; it can only make payments the policy allows. The scenarios a contract can express (16 of 40, and 7 of the 8 recipient checks) run against it on a local NEAR node in CI. An optional LLM demo checks NEAR AI Cloud response signatures. Mainnet signing is not supported.
```

## Before sending (the submission cannot be edited)

1. `pnpm check` passes on the commit you submit, and CI is green on GitHub for that commit.
2. The README "For judges" steps still produce the documented output from a fresh clone.
3. The full-history secret scan is clean.
4. The README's [Live testnet run](../README.md#live-testnet-run) section holds a verified transaction, or clearly says that none was run.
5. The X post is public, states that the project was built at NEAR HACKATHON, and links the repository.
6. The payout account ID is a mainnet account you control.

## Checklist

### Core engine
- [x] Policy schema implemented and documented (`docs/policy-schema.md`)
- [x] Every mandatory policy rule has positive and negative automated tests (`packages/core/test/engine.test.ts`)
- [x] Exact arithmetic (BigInt atomic units; JSON numbers rejected)
- [x] Fail-closed behaviour tested (ledger unavailable, validator throws, no verifier)
- [x] Aggregate spending is safe under the supported concurrency model (single process), with a control experiment showing the race when the lock is removed
- [x] Idempotency tested, including concurrent duplicates
- [x] `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` is never treated as an authorisation (nothing reserved; the gate refuses)

### Scenario runner
- [x] 40 executable built-in scenarios, plus 6 NEAR scenarios
- [x] Scenarios are schema-validated, including references between steps
- [x] `PASS`, `FAIL`, `ERROR` and `SKIPPED` are distinct; an all-skipped run is not a pass
- [x] Reports show expected and observed outcomes per step
- [x] Correct exit codes (0, 1, 2, 3), tested against the built binary

### CLI and CI
- [x] Quick-start works in a clean directory (`drainproof init`, `policy validate`, `test`)
- [x] Help and error messages include file, line and field locations
- [x] JSON and Markdown reports
- [x] GitHub Actions workflows run on GitHub ([Actions](https://github.com/Adeolu05/drainproof/actions))
- [x] An intentional policy violation makes the suite exit with code 1, locally and in the CI `regression-gate` job
- [x] Composite GitHub Action (`action.yml`): one `uses:` step and a policy file; rehearsed locally from an outside project (pass, then fail with the CRITICAL finding)
- [x] The action has run on GitHub: on [demo PR #2](https://github.com/Adeolu05/drainproof/pull/2) the `action` CI job passed and the Drainproof workflow failed the pull request with exit code 1, as intended
- [ ] The action used from another repository
- [x] Recipient-check pack (`examples/recipient-checks`): engine 8/8, vault 7 pass and 1 skipped, catches 7 loose matchers

### Dashboard
- [x] Data comes only from CLI reports (schema-validated); demo fixtures are generated by the real CLI and labelled
- [x] Run details and findings are inspectable
- [x] Error and empty states; invalid report files are surfaced
- [x] No fabricated metrics (pass rate is `n/a` when a run is incomplete)
- [x] Responsive layout and accessibility audited (no page overflow from 320 px to 2560 px, 0 axe-core WCAG 2.2 AA violations)

### NEAR integration
- [x] SDK calls verified against the official NEAR docs source (`github.com/near/docs`, commit `fa2acf6`) and the published `near-api-js@7.4.0` types
- [x] Runtime exercised against the real `near-api-js` library and a local RPC stub
- [x] Simulation and testnet execution are clearly separated (execution is off unless `DRAINPROOF_NEAR_EXECUTION=testnet`)
- [x] No private keys are committed or exposed
- [x] Blocked proposals make no RPC request; at most one broadcast per reservation (near-api-js retry layers neutralised)
- [x] Integration limitations documented (`docs/integrations.md`)
- [x] Live testnet run recorded and verified against the network: a 0.01 NEAR transfer on 2026-11-07 (`J8MThEg4yZetZXYZWNE7n12ZtdQcKNN58pKd8YvcoggN`), confirmed by three public testnet RPCs (see the README's [Live testnet run](../README.md#live-testnet-run))

### Drainproof Vault (NEAR contract)
- [x] Contract in Rust (`near-sdk` 5.30.0), built with `cargo-near` 0.22.0; design and threat model in [vault-design.md](vault-design.md)
- [x] The agent holds only a function-call key for `request_payment`; owner methods need the owner and exactly 1 yoctoNEAR
- [x] 40 unit tests and 37 tests on a local NEAR node (30 vault tests, 7 lock tests); 16 of the 40 built-in scenarios pass against the contract and 24 are skipped with reasons
- [x] Expired approval requests cannot jam the 50-slot approval queue (review fix, with unit and sandbox tests)
- [x] CI job defined (`vault` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- [x] CI job has run on GitHub (on `main`: [run](https://github.com/Adeolu05/drainproof/actions/runs/42311937868); on demo PR #2: [run](https://github.com/Adeolu05/drainproof/actions/runs/42311692824); both 2026-11-06, success)
- [x] Locked on testnet (2026-11-08): placeholder recipients removed ([ApgYHwq1…](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/ApgYHwq1g7XEKVJ5Q1K2jb1Vh78qqFRzrfdMTjpgftUn)), every access key of the vault account deleted ([FRbt93jy…](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/FRbt93jyyKgsLyyHvRfE9PnDAJRotWCdVVK55XNjXpiZ)); after the lock the agent's function-call key still paid the shop ([TsoccF9h…](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/TsoccF9hRu9azZbygGfkMtuS7zyTYCSbb2SvM8htQqD)) and was refused for `attacker.testnet` ([D2zXmkEc…](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/D2zXmkEcnV31CXsjtkRX6k3tKTcH1xYWv56hrDamUbgQ)), and the owner withdrew 0.05 NEAR through the contract ([3EcfAJKJ…](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/3EcfAJKJWwDAy9D4bYicrcsjmJ8xBD46rqH2oonZxLef)), all confirmed by two public RPCs
- [x] Deployed and exercised on testnet: `vault.dpeluola-owner.testnet` (2026-11-07), code byte-identical to a build of this repository; an allowed and a blocked payment signed with the agent's function-call key, confirmed by two public RPCs (README, [Drainproof Vault on testnet](../README.md#drainproof-vault-on-testnet))

### LLM prompt-injection demo
- [x] Agent loop with a poisoned page, every proposal through `authorize()` (`examples/llm-agent`), 12 offline tests
- [x] NEAR AI Cloud API checked against the official docs (base URL, key, request format, models, response signatures, attestation)
- [x] Optional vault mode on a local NEAR node prints the on-chain rejection event
- [ ] A real NEAR AI Cloud run recorded (needs the owner's API key); the shipped recording is a labelled stand-in
