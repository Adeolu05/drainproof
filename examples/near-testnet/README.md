# NEAR testnet example

This example has two parts.

1. **Policy test suite (works offline).** NEAR-specific scenarios run with the NEAR account-ID validator enabled: account-ID syntax, cross-network accounts, mainnet blocking, exact 24-decimal yoctoNEAR limits, and concurrent spending against a daily limit.

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @drainproof/example-near-testnet test
   ```

2. **Execution demo (`demo.mjs`).** By default this is a simulation: it evaluates three proposals and states that nothing was signed or sent. Real testnet execution happens only if you opt in with a **testnet** account you control:

   ```bash
   DRAINPROOF_NEAR_EXECUTION=testnet \
   NEAR_TESTNET_ACCOUNT_ID=<you>.testnet \
   NEAR_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY=ed25519:<testnet-only key> \
   RECIPIENT=<existing testnet account, also added to policy.yaml> \
   pnpm --filter @drainproof/example-near-testnet demo
   ```

   The allowed proposal passes through the Drainproof execution gate (`beginExecution`) and is broadcast with `near-api-js` (`Account.signAndSendTransaction` with a `transfer` action). For each executed transfer the demo prints the transaction hash exactly as the network returned it, a NearBlocks testnet explorer link and the final status, then re-reads the status from the RPC by hash (`JsonRpcProvider.viewTransactionStatus`, read-only). An ambiguous outcome is printed as `UNKNOWN`, never as a success. The executor refuses to run if the RPC does not report `testnet`, or if the signer is not a testnet account. With execution enabled, `RECIPIENT` is required.

**Verification status:** the adapter is tested against a fake client and, through the real `near-api-js@7.4.0` code, against a local JSON-RPC stub. Those tests check that blocked proposals make no RPC request at all, that exactly one transaction is broadcast per reservation, and that the signed transfer has the right receiver and amount. The SDK calls were checked against the official NEAR docs (source repository `github.com/near/docs`, commit `fa2acf6`). One live testnet run was made on 2026-11-07 (a 0.01 NEAR transfer, confirmed by three public RPCs); see the README's [Live testnet run](../../README.md#live-testnet-run) section. Follow the step-by-step procedure in [docs/testnet-run.md](../../docs/testnet-run.md) and check the hash it prints before relying on it.

Never use a mainnet key here. Never commit keys; pass them through the environment or your CI secret store.
