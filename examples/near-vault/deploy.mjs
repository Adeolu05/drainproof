// The contract's code needs about 1.9 NEAR of storage stake, so with the default funding
// about 1.1 NEAR remains available for payments (measured in the sandbox; see README).
//
// Two transactions:
//  1. The owner creates the vault account, funds it, and adds the owner's own public key as
//     its full-access key (so the owner can redeploy or clean up; no new key is created).
//  2. The vault account deploys the contract and calls `new` in the same transaction, so
//     nobody can initialise it in between (`new` is private to the vault account).
